### Getting Instagram Cookies

1. Log in to Instagram in your web browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Visit any Instagram page (like your feed)
5. Click on any request to `www.instagram.com` in the Network tab
6. In the Headers tab, find the `cookie` header
7. Copy the entire cookie string
8. Create a `.env` file in the Instagram folder with the cookie:
   ```
   INSTAGRAM_COOKIE=your_cookie_string_here
   ```
   
   Or you can paste just the cookie string directly into the file:
   ```
   mid=...; ig_did=...; csrftoken=...; ds_user_id=...; sessionid=...
   ```

### Configuration

You can adjust the following settings in `Instagram/insta.py`:

```python
# Limits
MAX_FOLLOWS = 400           # Maximum number of followers/following to fetch
PAGE_SIZE_FOLLOWS = 50      # Number of follows per API request
MAX_POSTS = 1000000         # Maximum posts to fetch (effectively no limit)
MAX_TAGGED = 1000000        # Maximum tagged posts to fetch
MAX_LIKES_PER_POST = 1000   # Maximum likes to fetch per post
PAGE_SIZE_LIKES = 50        # Number of likes per API request
MAX_COMMENTS_PER_POST = 1000 # Maximum comments to fetch per post
PAGE_SIZE_COMMENTS = 50     # Number of comments per API request

# Timing (in seconds)
SLEEP_MIN = 0.7            # Minimum delay between requests
SLEEP_MAX = 1.5            # Maximum delay between requests
```

### API Hashes

The Instagram scraper uses GraphQL query hashes to access different endpoints. These hashes may change when Instagram updates their API. If you encounter issues, you may need to update these hashes in `Instagram/insta.py`:

```python
# Common query_hash values (update these if Instagram changes them)
HASH_FOLLOWERS = "c76146de99bb02f6415203be841dd25a"
HASH_FOLLOWING = "d04b0a864b4b54837c0d870b0e77e076"
HASH_LIKES = "d5d763b1e2acf209d62d22d184488e57"
HASH_COMMENTS = "bc3296d1ce80a24b1b6e40b1e72903f5"
HASH_TAGGED = "ff260833edf142911047af6024eb634a"
```

To find updated hashes:
1. Log in to Instagram in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Perform the action you're having trouble with (e.g., viewing followers)
5. Look for requests to `graphql/query/`
6. The `query_hash` parameter will contain the current hash

## Facebook Scraper

A simple tool to download all public posts, comments, and media from Facebook profiles and pages.

### Setup

1. Get your Facebook cookies:
   - Log in to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application > Storage > Cookies > https://www.facebook.com
   - Right-click and "Copy All as Netscape cookie file"

2. Create a `.env` file in the Facebook directory and paste the cookies:
   ```
   # Paste your Facebook cookies here
   # Format: .facebook.com\tTRUE\t/\tTRUE\t0\t[COOKIE_NAME]\t[COOKIE_VALUE]
   # ... (paste all cookie lines here)
   ```

3. Make sure your `.env` file is in the same directory as `facebook.py`

### Usage

Just run the script and enter the profile name or URL when prompted:

```bash
python Facebook/facebook.py
```

### What's Scraped

- Profile information (name, about, profile picture)
- All public posts with full text and media
- Comments and replies
- Embedded images and videos

### Output

An interactive HTML report named `[username]_facebook.html` will be created in the current directory.

### Note
