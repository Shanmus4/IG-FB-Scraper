# Note: Playwright requires an extra step to download browser binaries after the Python package is
# installed. Keep the package entry above, then run the appropriate install command for browsers:
#
#
# To install only Chromium (smaller download):
#   python -m playwright install chromium
#
# If you use a CI/CD environment, run the same command in the pipeline to provision browsers.
